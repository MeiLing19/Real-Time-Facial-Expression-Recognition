<h2>Abstract</h2>
Facial emotion recognition (FER) is the technology or process of identifying and interpretinghuman emotions based on the analysis of facial expressions. It involves using computeralgorithms and machine learning techniques to detect and classify emotional states from imagesor videos of human faces. Further, FER plays a vital role in recognizing and understandinghuman emotions to better interpret someone's feelings, intentions, and attitudes. In the presenttime, it is widely used in various  ̄elds such as healthcare, human–computer interaction, lawenforcement, security, and beyond. FER has a wide range of practical applications acrossvarious industries including Emotion Monitoring, Adaptive Learning, and Virtual Assistants.This paper presents a comparative analysis of FER algorithms, focusing on deep learningapproaches. The performance of di®erent datasets, including FER2013, JAFFE, A®ectNet, andCohn–Kanade, is evaluated using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), deep face, attentionalconvolutional networks (ACNs), and deep belief networks (DBNs). Among the tested algo-rithms, DBNs outperformed other algorithms, reaching the highest accuracy of 98.82%. Theseresults emphasize the e®ectiveness of deep learning techniques, particularly DBNs, in FER.Additionally, outlining the advantages and disadvantages of current research on facial emotionidenti ̄cation might direct future research e®orts in the direction of the most pro ̄tabledirections.
